<p>It was the spring of 2000 when I was in eighth grade. I had come to visit <span id="pva">_______________</span> to experience boarding high school. Up until this point I had lived at home and attended private school for my first 8 grades. My father attended a boarding Academy for his high school years in the town of Monterey Bay California. My dad has very fond memories I'm going to Academy and is still friends With his high school roommate with whom he keeps in contact with to this day. thinking that I would enjoy the experience, I was paired with a friend of mine who was at the time a Junior.</p>
<p>The whole event started on a Friday morning extending through Sunday. As part of the preview day, the students were taken around the campus to observe classes and activities. The school itself was a work study program allowing students to pay their way by working either on a <span id = "industries">_______________</span> as well as other campus industrial or academic occupations.</p>
<p>Friday afternoon I was surprised to find out that my friend, Chris, was also hosting another guest in his room for the preview days. The guest happened to be his younger brother, <span id = "matt">_______________</span>. being a bit more conservative than the average person my age is part of why Chris and I were friends. if there was a contrast in character between two brothers, Matt and Chris were such a pair.</p>
<p>My first impression of Matt was not kind. I found him to be loud and obnoxious as well as filled with information and interests to which I had no inclination, primarily sports. As the dormitories settled down, the Dean would make his rounds to make sure everyone was settling in for the night. Most notably, he was not pleased that there was still conversation going on in our dorm room as Matt couldn’t seem to stop talking. This constant action not only annoyed me, but put us on bad terms with the Dean. I cannot recall specifics, but I do remember that we didn't end up getting to sleep until after 2:00 AM.</p>
<p>Despite this experience, I ended up enrolling a Platte Valley Academy the following fall as a village student (a student which commuted from home rather than living in the dormitory). On my sophomore year I was re acquainted with Matt when he enrolled. I had begun learning to play the guitar in interest of writing songs. My talent for the instrument was minor and the only instrument to practice with was owned by another student.</p>
<p>At one point in the fall, I had completed writing a <span id = "song">_______________</span>, and had a basic melody to go with it. The problem then presented, that I have no way to write the music. When I inquired to Chris, who also played the guitar, it was met with agreement, but seemed to be constantly pushed out. Bringing this fact up to him did not improve the situation. At one point I remember him telling me to go and see his brother as he also played. I must admit I was loathed to take his suggestion. However, after not being able to progress any further with my songwriting, I finally approached him one Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>To my shock, he was quite willing to listen and help. We spent the better part of 2 1/2 hours sitting outside working through the lyrics I had created and nearing the end, had a very passable accompaniment. It was that afternoon when I changed my mind about Matt. </p>
<p>Over the next three years, our friendship grew stronger. our freshman of college year was spent at the same campus before we parted for separate academic careers. The friendship that began so unexpected, became a lasting and deep friendship. Each of us was best man at the other’s wedding and still talk on a weekly basis. He works as a coach and teacher at a similar academy from which we both graduated and he remains to this day, <span id = "myFriend">_______________</span>.</p>
